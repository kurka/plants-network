==============

network.py works with a network, where each node has a value, simulating a network of plants, with different levels of energy.
The network is capable of transmiting energy, from nodes with more energy, to individuals with less.

evolution.py is an evolutionary algorithm to find the network topology that optimize this exchanges.
